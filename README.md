MyDayLogger is an Android application leveraging wearable technology and its sensors to detect  potential seizures in users. Upon detection, the application promptly initiates a distress notification to a predefined caretaker, incorporating the precise geographic coordinates of the user for efficient and timely assistance.

This repository contains 2 applications, one for a mobile device (phone), named app and another for a wearable device, named wearosaccelerometerdata.

To run, simply open the project root in Android Studio and select on which app and which device (provided they are compatible) to execute or open the APK in your device.
(If you are using a device with Android 10+, you might need to go to Settings and allow Location permission at all times to the MyDayLogger app)
